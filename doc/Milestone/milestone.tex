%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}

A consequence of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is that mass bends the
path of light. When light passes through a particularly deep gravitational
potential, the deflections, called strong gravitational lenses, can produce
brilliant arcs and multiple images. The number and distribution of strong
lenses reflect the expansion history of the universe.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Problem Statement}

In this project we will use images collected by the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope Legacy Survey to analyze how Convolution Neural Networks can improve
automated detection of strong lens systems. From other graduate work (but not
coursework), we have the locations and categories of around one hundred and
twenty known strong lenses, three thousand large fields verified to contain no
strong lenses, six thousand simulated strong lenses, and several thousand
classifications by citizen-scientists of other potential strong lens systems.
These will form the core of our training and testing datasets; our metric will
be how well a CNN correctly identifies known and simulated lenses and non-lens
systems.

We would like to examine the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{ Do we have enough data to reasonably train and test a CNN? Can we get
       around this by artificially inflating the data, e.g. by adding rotated
     images?}
\item{ What processing needs to be done on the data? What kind of scaling of
       pixel data is appropriate for automated detection? Should we compress
     the five different 'colors' to a smaller number of dimensions?}
   \item{ How do citizen-scientists do compared with this automated system?}
   \item{Can we use the results of citizen-scientists to train the CNN?}
\item{What sets of classifications are needed? Are we better served sticking
       to 'lens' and 'not lens', or should we use several classification
       categories ('lensed arcs', 'lensed multiple images', 'non-lens pixel
     noise')?}
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Technical Approach}

From approximately 12000 fields of $440\times440\times3$ fields, we have
constructed <> cutouts sized $96\times96\times3$. These cutouts 


We plan to train a classifier on this data using two different methods. First, we will code 
our own convolutional net in python using theano. Second, we will apply transfer learning 
techniques to train on a convolutional net galaxy morphology classifier, which has graciously 
been made available to us by Ryan Keisler and which achieved 7th place in the 2014 Galaxy 
Zoo Kaggle competition. This classifier runs $96\times96$ images through 3 convolutional 
layers and 2 fully-connected layers and predicts a galaxy to have one of 37 enumerated 
morphologies. We plan to train our classifier on top of the first full-connected layer, which 
has 500 neurons. 

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Intermediate/Preliminary Results}

We have begun constructing our own convolutional network with two convolutional/max-pool 
layers and two fully-connected layers. Although we have not yet trained on our lensing images,
we can load these images and run them through our initialized classifier.
