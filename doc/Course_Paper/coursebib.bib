	Title = {{Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift}},
	Year = 2015,
	Abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	Year = 2015,
	Abstract = {We present the spectroscopic redshift catalog from a wide-field survey of the fields of 28 galaxy-mass strong gravitational lenses. We discuss the acquisition and reduction of the survey data, collected over 40 nights of 6.5m MMT and Magellan time, employing four different multi-object spectrographs. We determine that no biases are introduced by combining datasets obtained with different instrument/spectrograph combinations. Special care is taken to determine redshift uncertainties using repeat observations. The redshift catalog consists of 9768 new and unique galaxy redshifts. 82.4% of the catalog redshifts are between z=0.1 and z=0.7, and the catalog median redshift is z=0.36. The data from this survey will be used to study the lens environments and line-of-sight structures to gain a better understanding of the effects of large scale structure on lens statistics and lens-derived parameters.},

The discussion is divided into 9 sections. We start in Sect 2 with an introduction to the observational data. In Sect 3 we outline the basic principles of strong lenses, building on the general theory of lensing from Part 1. In Sect. 4 we discuss modeling gravitational lenses and the determination of the mass distribution of lens galaxies. In Sect 5 we discuss time delays and the Hubble constant. In Sect. 6 we discuss gravitational lens statistics and the cosmological model. In Sect. 7 we discuss the differences between galaxies and clusters as lenses. In Sect. 8 we discuss the effects of substructure or satellites on gravitational lenses. In Sect. 9 we discuss the optical properties of lens galaxies and in Sect. 10 we discuss extended sources and quasar host galaxies. Finally in Sect. 11 we discuss the future of strong gravitational lensing.},

	Abstract = {We present a strong lens analysis of SDSS J1004+4112, a unique quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.68, using newly developed software for gravitational lensing. We find that our parametric mass model well reproduces all observations, including the positions of quasar images as well as those of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, time delays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. The predicted large total magnification of mu ˜ 70 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal, centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness profile. In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial profile of the best-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted A-D time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time-delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model.},

	Title = {{Prospects for Measuring the Mass of Black Holes at High Redshifts with Resolved Kinematics Using Gravitational Lensing}},
	Year = 2014,
	Abstract = {Application of the most robust method of measuring black hole masses, spatially resolved kinematics of gas and stars, is presently limited to nearby galaxies. The Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) and thirty meter class telescopes (the Thirty Meter Telescope, the Giant Magellan Telescope, and the European Extremely Large Telescope) with milli-arcsecond resolution are expected to extend such measurements to larger distances. Here, we study the possibility of exploiting the angular magnification provided by strong gravitational lensing to measure black hole masses at high redshifts (z~ 1-6), using resolved gas kinematics with these instruments. We show that in ~15% and ~20% of strongly lensed galaxies, the inner 25 and 50 pc could be resolved, allowing the mass of ~$10^8 M_{\odot}$ black holes to be dynamically measured with ALMA, if moderately bright molecular gas is present at these small radii. Given the large number of strong lenses discovered in current millimeter surveys and future optical surveys, this fraction could constitute a statistically significant population for studying the evolution of the M-$\sigma$ relation at high redshifts.},

	Volume = 482,
	Year = 1997,
	Abstract = {Continued photometric monitoring of the gravitational lens system 0957+561A, B in the g and r bands with the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5 m telescope during 1996 shows a sharp g-band event in the trailing (B) image light curve at the precise time predicted in an earlier paper. The prediction was based on the observation of the event during 1995 in the leading (A) image and on a differential time delay of 415 days. This success confirms the so-called short delay, and the absence of any such feature at a delay near 540 days rejects the "long delay" for this system, thus resolving a long-standing controversy. A series of statistical analyses of our light-curve data yield a best-fit delay of 417 +/- 3 days (95% confidence interval) and demonstrate that this result is quite robust against variations in the analysis technique, data subsamples, and assumed parametric relationship of the two light curves. Recent improvements in the modeling of the lens system (consisting of a galaxy plus a galaxy cluster) allow us to derive a value of the global value (at z = 0.36) of Hubble's constant H0 using Refsdal's method, a simple and direct (single-step) distance determination based on experimentally verified and securely understood physics and geometry. The result is H0 = 64 +/- 13 km s-1 Mpc-1 (for Omega = 1), where this 95% confidence interval is dominantly due to remaining lens model uncertainties. However, it is reassuring that available observations of the lensing mass distribution over-constrain the model and thus provide an internal consistency check on its validity. We argue that this determination of the extragalactic distance scale (10% accurate at 1 sigma ) is now of comparable quality, in terms of both statistical and systematic uncertainties, to those based on more conventional techniques. Finally, we briefly discuss the prospects for improved H0 determinations using gravitational lenses, and some other possible implications and uses of the 0957+561A, B light curves.},

	Volume = 753,
	Year = 2012,
	Abstract = {The galaxy cluster IDCS J1426.5+3508 at z = 1.75 is the most massive galaxy cluster yet discovered at z > 1.4 and the first cluster at this epoch for which the Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich effect has been observed. In this paper, we report on the discovery with Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a giant arc associated with this cluster. The curvature of the arc suggests that the lensing mass is nearly coincident with the brightest cluster galaxy, and the color is consistent with the arc being a star-forming galaxy. We compare the constraint on M 200 based upon strong lensing with Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich results, finding that the two are consistent if the redshift of the arc is z >~ 3. Finally, we explore the cosmological implications of this system, considering the likelihood of the existence of a strongly lensing galaxy cluster at this epoch in a LambdaCDM universe. While the existence of the cluster itself can potentially be accommodated if one considers the entire volume covered at this redshift by all current high-redshift cluster surveys, the existence of this strongly lensed galaxy greatly exacerbates the long-standing giant arc problem. For standard LambdaCDM structure formation and observed background field galaxy counts this lens system should not exist. Specifically, there should be no giant arcs in the entire sky as bright in F814W as the observed arc for clusters at z >= 1.75, and only ~0.3 as bright in F160W as the observed arc. If we relax the redshift constraint to consider all clusters at z >= 1.5, the expected number of giant arcs rises to ~15 in F160W, but the number of giant arcs of this brightness in F814W remains zero. These arc statistic results are independent of the mass of IDCS J1426.5+3508. We consider possible explanations for this discrepancy.},

	Title = {{Strong lensing, time delays, and the value of H\$\_0\$}},
	Year = 2014,
	Abstract = {In principle, the most straightforward method of estimating the Hubble constant relies on time delays between mirage images of strongly-lensed sources. It is a puzzle, then, that the values of H$_0$ obtained with this method span a range from $\sim 50 - 100$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. Quasars monitored to measure these time delays, are multi-component objects. The variability may arise from different components of the quasar or may even originate from a jet. Misidentifying a variable emitting region in a jet with emission from the core region may introduce an error in the Hubble constant derived from a time delay. Here, we investigate the complex structure of sources as the underlying physical explanation of the wide spread in values of the Hubble constant based on gravitational lensing. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the potentially large impact of the position of the variable emitting region on H$_0$ determination. The derived value of the Hubble constant is very sensitive to the offset between the center of the emission and the center of the variable emitting region. Based on these simulations, we propose using the value of H$_0$ known from other techniques to spatially resolve the origin of the variable emission once the time delay is measured. We advocate this method particularly for gamma-ray astronomy, where the angular resolution of detectors reaches approximately 0.1 degree; lensed blazars offer the only route for identify the origin of gamma-ray flares. Large future samples of gravitationally lensed sources identified with Euclid, SKA, and LSST will enable a statistical determination of H$_0$. The method should also provide new insights into the structure of the sources and their cosmic evolution at different energies.},

	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing forms multiple, time delayed images of cosmological sources, with the "focal length" of the lens serving as a cosmological distance probe. Robust estimation of the time delay distance can tightly constrain the Hubble constant as well as the matter density and dark energy. Current and next generation surveys will find hundreds to thousands of lensed systems but accurate time delay estimation from noisy, gappy lightcurves is potentially a limiting systematic. Using a large sample of blinded lightcurves from the Strong Lens Time Delay Challenge we develop and demonstrate a Gaussian Process crosscorrelation technique that delivers an average bias within 0.1% depending on the sampling, necessary for subpercent Hubble constant determination. The fits are accurate (80% of them within 1 day) for delays from 5-100 days and robust against cadence variations shorter than 6 days. We study the effects of survey characteristics such as cadence, season, and campaign length, and derive requirements for time delay cosmology: in order not to bias the cosmology determination by $0.5\sigma$, the mean time delay fit accuracy must be better than 0.2%.},

	Abstract = {Under the assumption of a flat LambdaCDM cosmology, recent data from the Planck satellite point toward a Hubble constant that is in tension with that measured by gravitational lens time delays and by the local distance ladder. Prosaically, this difference could arise from unknown systematic uncertainties in some of the measurements. More interestingly---if systematics were ruled out---resolving the tension would require a departure from the flat LambdaCDM cosmology, introducing, for example, a modest amount of spatial curvature, or a non-trivial dark energy equation of state. To begin to address these issues, we present an analysis of the gravitational lens RXJ1131--1231 that is improved in one particular regard: we examine the issue of systematic error introduced by an assumed lens model density profile. We use more flexible gravitational lens models with baryonic and dark matter components, and find that the exquisite Hubble Space Telescope image with thousands of intensity pixels in the Einstein ring and the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens contain sufficient information to constrain these more flexible models. The total uncertainty on the time-delay distance is 6.6% for a single system. We proceed to combine our improved time-delay distance measurement with the WMAP9 and Planck posteriors. In an open LambdaCDM model, the data for RXJ1131--1231 in combination with Planck favor a flat universe with \Omega _k=0.00^{+0.01}_{-0.02} (68% credible interval (CI)). In a flat wCDM model, the combination of RXJ1131--1231 and Planck yields w=-1.52^{+0.19}_{-0.20} (68% CI).},

	Title = {{The effects of structure anisotropy on lensing observables in an exact general relativistic setting for precision cosmology}},
	Volume = 3,
	Year = 2014,
	Abstract = {The study of relativistic, higher order, and nonlinear effects has become necessary in recent years in the pursuit of precision cosmology. We develop and apply here a framework to study gravitational lensing in exact models in general relativity that are not restricted to homogeneity and isotropy, and where full nonlinearity and relativistic effects are thus naturally included. We apply the framework to a specific, anisotropic galaxy cluster model which is based on a modified NFW halo density profile and described by the Szekeres metric. We examine the effects of increasing levels of anisotropy in the galaxy cluster on lensing observables like the convergence and shear for various lensing geometries, finding a strong nonlinear response in both the convergence and shear for rays passing through anisotropic regions of the cluster. Deviation from the expected values in a spherically symmetric structure are asymmetric with respect to path direction and thus will persist as a statistical effect when averaged over some ensemble of such clusters. The resulting relative difference in various geometries can be as large as approximately 2%, 8%, and 24% in the measure of convergence (1-kappa) for levels of anisotropy of 5%, 10%, and 15%, respectively, as a fraction of total cluster mass. For the total magnitude of shear, the relative difference can grow near the center of the structure to be as large as 15%, 32%, and 44% for the same levels of anisotropy, averaged over the two extreme geometries. The convergence is impacted most strongly for rays which pass in directions along the axis of maximum dipole anisotropy in the structure, while the shear is most strongly impacted for rays which pass in directions orthogonal to this axis, as expected. The rich features found in the lensing signal due to anisotropic substructure are nearly entirely lost when one treats the cluster in the traditional FLRW lensing framework. These effects due to anisotropic structures are thus likely to impact lensing measurements and must be fully examined in an era of precision cosmology.},

	Abstract = {The Euclid space telescope will observe ~10^5 strong galaxy-galaxy gravitational lens events in its wide field imaging survey over around half the sky, but identifying the gravitational lenses from their observed morphologies requires solving the difficult problem of reliably separating the lensed sources from contaminant populations, such as tidal tails, as well as presenting challenges for spectroscopic follow-up redshift campaigns. Here I present alternative selection techniques for strong gravitational lenses in both Euclid and the Square Kilometer Array, exploiting the strong magnification bias present in the steep end of the Halpha luminosity function and HI mass function. Around 10^3 strong lensing events are detectable with this method in the Euclid wide survey. While only ~1% of the total haul of Euclid lenses, this sample has ~100% reliability, known source redshifts, high signal-to-noise and a magnification-based selection independent of assumptions of lens morphology. With the proposed Square Kilometer Array dark energy survey, the numbers of reliable strong gravitational lenses with source redshifts can reach 10^5.},

This method is applied to the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), a deep ground-based weak lensing survey imaging to R ~ 26. The parameter space of arcs in the DLS is simulated using real galaxies extracted from deep Hubble Space Telescope fields in order to more accurately reproduce the properties of arcs. Arcs are detected in the DLS using a pixel thresholding method and candidate arcs are selected within this multiparameter space. Examples of strong galaxy-galaxy lens candidates discovered in the DLS F2 field (4deg2) are presented.},

	Abstract = {Gravitationally lensed quasars are brighter than their unlensed counterparts and produce images with distinctive morphological signatures. Past searches and target-selection algorithms, in particular the Sloan Quasar Lens Search (SQLS), have relied on basic morphological criteria, which were applied to samples of bright, spectroscopically confirmed quasars. The SQLS techniques are not sufficient for searching into new surveys (e.g. DES, PS1, LSST), because spectroscopic information is not readily available and the large data volume requires higher purity in target/candidate selection. We carry out a systematic exploration of machine-learning techniques and demonstrate that a two-step strategy can be highly effective. In the first step, we use catalogue-level information (griz+WISE magnitudes, second moments) to pre-select targets, using artificial neural networks. The accepted targets are then inspected with pixel-by-pixel pattern recognition algorithms (gradient-boosted trees), to form a final set of candidates. The results from this procedure can be used to further refine the simpler SQLS algorithms, with a twofold (or threefold) gain in purity and the same (or 80 per cent) completeness at target-selection stage, or a purity of 70 per cent and a completeness of 60 per cent after the candidate-selection step. Simpler photometric searches in griz+WISE based on colour cuts would provide samples with 7 per cent purity or less. Our technique is extremely fast, as a list of candidates can be obtained from a Stage III experiment (e.g. DES catalogue/data base) in a few CPU hours. The techniques are easily extendable to Stage IV experiments like LSST with the addition of time domain information.},

	Title = {{Chitah: Strong-gravitational-lens hunter in imaging surveys}},
	Year = 2014,
	Abstract = {Strong gravitationally lensed quasars provide powerful means to study galaxy evolution and cosmology. Current and upcoming imaging surveys will contain thousands of new lensed quasars, augmenting the existing sample by at least two orders of magnitudes. To find such lens systems, we built a robot, Chitah, that hunts for lensed quasars by modeling the configuration of the multiple quasar images. Specifically, given an image of an object that might be a lensed quasar, Chitah first disentangles the light from the supposed lens galaxy and the light from the multiple quasar images based on color information. A simple rule is designed to categorize the given object into a potential four-image (quad) or two-image (double) lensed quasar system. The configuration of the identified quasar images is subsequently modeled to classify whether the object is a lensed quasar system. We test the performance of Chitah using simulated lens systems based on the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Legacy Survey. For bright quads with large image separations (with Einstein radius $r_{\rm ein}>1.1"$), a high true-positive rate of $>$$90\%$ and a low false-positive rate of $<$$3\%$ show that this is a promising approach to search for new lens systems. We obtain high true-positive rate for lens systems with $r_{\rm ein}\gtrsim0.5"$, so the performance of Chitah is set by the seeing. We further feed a known gravitational lens system, COSMOS 5921+0638, to Chitah, and demonstrate that Chitah is able to classify successfully this real gravitational lens system. Our newly built Chitah is omnivorous and can hunt in any ground-based imaging surveys.},
